##### Stage 01 (part 1 of 6) #####
tutorial.stage01h1=Ubiquity Tutorial, part 1 of 6: How to start Ubiquity
tutorial.stage01p1=Welcome to the Ubiquity tutorial.
tutorial.stage01p2=Let's get started.  To summon Ubiquity, do this now:
tutorial.stage01p3=Hold down the %S key and tap the %S key.

##### Stage 02
tutorial.stage02p1=This is the Ubiquity <strong>input box</strong>.  You can type commands here.
tutorial.stage02p2=If you want to get out of Ubiquity without giving a command, <strong>tap the Escape key</strong>.  Try that now.

##### Stage 03 (part 2 of 6) #####
tutorial.stage03h1=Ubiquity Tutorial, part 2 of 6: Weather command and Previews
tutorial.stage03p1=OK, so now let's learn a command. Summon Ubiquity again...
tutorial.stage03p2=(Remember, <strong>hold down the %S key and tap the %S key</strong>.)

##### Stage 04
tutorial.stage04p1=Now type the word <strong>weather</strong>...

##### Stage 05
tutorial.stage05p1=Even before you're done typing, the <strong>preview area</strong> shows a preview of the results of your command &#8212; in this case, a weather report.
tutorial.stage05p2=If you don't enter a location, the <em>weather</em> command takes a guess as to where you are.
tutorial.stage05p3=Now let's give it a location: <strong>type a space, and then type 'near chicago'</strong>. (So your whole input will say: 'weather near chicago'.)

##### Stage 06
tutorial.stage06p1=See how that works?  Feel free to delete &quot;chicago&quot; and try some other locations.
tutorial.stage06p2=When you're done checking the weather, <strong>hit the escape key.</strong>

##### Stage 07 (part 3 of 6) #####
tutorial.stage07h1=Ubiquity Tutorial, part 3 of 6: Calculate command and Abbreviations
tutorial.stage07p1=Summon Ubiquity again, and we'll learn some more commands.

##### Stage 08
tutorial.stage08p1=This time, <strong>type just the letter 'c'</strong> (lower-case) and see what happens.

##### Stage 09
tutorial.stage09p1=The Ubiquity <strong>suggestion list</strong> displays commands that start with the letter 'C'.
tutorial.stage09p2=Let's say you want the <em>calculate</em> command.  You don't have to type the whole command name.  Just <strong>type the letters 'al'</strong> (so that your input says <strong>'cal'</strong>).

##### Stage 10
tutorial.stage10p1=Now <strong>type a space, and then type 22/7</strong> (so that your input says <strong>'cal 22/7'</strong>.)

##### Stage 11
tutorial.stage11p1=The <em>calculate</em> command will show you the result of any arithmetic expression you type in.
tutorial.stage11p2=When you're done experimenting with <em>calculate</em>, <strong>hit the escape key.</strong>

##### Stage 12 (part 4 of 6) #####
tutorial.stage12h1=Ubiquity Tutorial, part 4 of 6: Google command and the suggestion list
tutorial.stage12p1=Summon Ubiquity again...

##### Stage 13
tutorial.stage13p1=Let's say you want to search Google for cheese.
tutorial.stage13p2=Type the letter 'g', a space, and the word 'cheese'.
tutorial.stage13p3=(Like, 'g cheese').

##### Stage 14
tutorial.stage14p1=In the suggestion list, you can see several commands that start with 'g'.  You can use the up-arrow and down-arrow keys to move through the suggestion list.  Try it now:
tutorial.stage14p2=<strong>tap the down-arrow key</strong> until the <em>google</em> command is hilighted.

##### Stage 15
tutorial.stage15p1=The <em>Google</em> command preview shows a snippet from each search result matching your search term.
tutorial.stage15p2=Those titles are links &#8212; you can click on one of them to open the page in a new tab.
tutorial.stage15p3=When you're done, close that page and come back here, or just <strong>tap escape</strong> to move on with the tutorial.

##### Stage 16 (part 5 of 6) #####
tutorial.stage16ah1=Part 5 of 6: Selecting and Executing
tutorial.stage16ap1=Say you're browsing the web and you come across an address &#8212; like the one in the box below &#8212; and you'd like to see it on a map.
tutorial.stage16ap2=Ubiquity commands can work on your text selection.  Try it out: Use the mouse to <strong>select the address</strong> below. Then <strong>summon Ubiquity</strong>.

tutorial.stage16bp1=Now <strong>type 'map'</strong>.

tutorial.stage16cp1=The preview shows a Google Map of the address. You can click on this map to make it bigger; then you can scroll around on the map by dragging it.  Try that now.
tutorial.stage16cp2=When you're done trying out the map, <strong>hit escape</strong>.

##### Stage 17
tutorial.stage17p1=As another example, say you're browsing the web and you come across something written in a language you can't read &#8212; like the Japanese text below.  You can use Ubiquity to get a translation.
tutorial.stage17p2=First <strong>select the Japanese text below</strong>, then bring up Ubiquity and <strong>use the <em>translate</em> command</strong>.
tutorial.stage17p3=(type 'translate', or just 'tr').

##### Stage 18
tutorial.stage18p1=At this point, you could type in some words that you want to have Ubiquity translate.  But as you can see in the preview area, Ubiquity is already translating the words that you have selected.
tutorial.stage18p2=Next, <strong>tap the enter key</strong> to execute the command.

##### Stage 19
tutorial.stage19p1=Notice how the Japanese text that you selected was <em>replaced</em> with the translation.  That's because you executed the command by pressing 'enter'.
tutorial.stage19p2=Each command does something different when you execute it.  Most often, it will open a new page, or change something on the current page.
tutorial.stage19p3=Click here to continue

##### Stage 20
tutorial.stage20p1=Let's do one more example.  Say you're browsing the web and you come across an unfamiliar word &#8212; like the one in the box below &#8212; and you'd like to look it up.
tutorial.stage20p2=Select the word in the box below and then summon Ubiquity.

##### Stage 21
tutorial.stage21p1=Now <strong>use the google command</strong> (type 'google' or just 'goo').

##### Stage 22
tutorial.stage22p1=Now, if the preview of the <em>google</em> command tells you what you want to know, then you're done &#8212; you can dismiss Ubiquity and go on your way.
tutorial.stage22p2=But if you want more information, you can tap the enter key to execute the <em>google</em> command, which will open the search results in a new page.
tutorial.stage22p3=It's up to you.

##### Stage 23 (part 6 of 6) #####
tutorial.stage23h1=Part 6 of 6: Getting Help and Learning More Commands
tutorial.stage23p1=So far you've learned the <em>weather</em>, <em>calculate</em>, <em>google</em>, <em>translate</em>, and <em>map</em> commands. That's a good start, but there are dozens more commands included with Ubiquity &#8212; plus you can find more on the Web.
tutorial.stage23p2=How will you find out what commands are available?
tutorial.stage23p3=One way is by using the <em>help</em> command.
tutorial.stage23p4=Summon Ubiquity...

##### Stage 24
tutorial.stage24p1=Suppose you want to know if there are any commands that deal with tabs.  You can use the <em>help</em> command like this:
tutorial.stage24p2=type 'help tab'.

##### Stage 25
tutorial.stage25p1=In the suggestion list, you can see all of the commands that have 'tab' in their names.
tutorial.stage25p2=Use the arrow keys to move through the suggestion list.  The preview area shows help information about each command that you highlight.
tutorial.stage25p3=When you're done, <strong>tap escape</strong>.

##### Stage 26
tutorial.stage26p1=Finally, there's the <em>list ubiquity commands</em> command. This command will take you to a page that shows every command Ubiquity has installed.  You can learn all sorts of useful things by browsing the command list page!
tutorial.stage26p2=This is the end of the tutorial. Once you go to the command list page, you are on your own to experiment and learn new commands at your own pace.
tutorial.stage26p3=Summon Ubiquity, type 'list', and tap the enter key to execute.
tutorial.stage26p4=Good-bye!
