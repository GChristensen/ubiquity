This is a patched clone of the original repository by [satyr](http://profile.hatena.ne.jp/murky-satyr/) at: https://bitbucket.org/satyr/ubiquity

Enhancements in this patched version: 

* [subscribe locally](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/murky-satyr/20090308/subscribe_locally) command added as a builtin one
* commands at the suggestion list are dedashed (but you don't need to type the dash in the input prompt even in the original version)

This is an unsigned addon (it seems, that it will be possible to sign the future versions of ubiquity, if any, only by special request to Mozilla).
To use it you need to know how to [disable](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#FAQ) extension signing (there is also a more harsh 
[option](https://github.com/5digits/dactyl/wiki/Disable-extension-signing-requirement-in-Firefox-49-or-later) that works for all Firefox versions).

You can find the original signed version at satyr's repository.
