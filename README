Installing Ubiquity
-------------------

To install Ubiquity for development purposes to your default Firefox
profile, just enter the root directory of your Ubiquity source code
checkout and run:

  python manage.py install

If you have a separate profile that you'd prefer to install the
extension under, such as 'testing', you can add that as an optional
parameter:

  python manage.py install --profile=testing

Using Ubiquity
--------------

Once Ubiquity has been installed, you should be able to start up
Firefox and press Ctrl+Space or Alt+Space (depending on your OS).  A
command entry window should pop up, which--for the time being--is the
primary way through which Ubiquity commands are entered. Now type
'help' and press enter.  The page that shows up should guide you from
there.

Uninstalling Ubiquity
---------------------

Just run "python manage.py uninstall", optionally specifying a profile
name/directory if necessary.  Alternatively, you can also uninstall
the extension through the normal Firefox addon management UI.

Building an XPI
---------------

To build an XPI for Ubiquity, just run:

  python manage.py xpi

This will create an XPI with the name "ubiquity-<version>.xpi", where
"<version>" is taken from the contents of the "em:version" element in the
"ubiquity/install.rdf" file.

Test Suite
----------

Once the extension is installed, the Ubiquity test suite can be run at:

  chrome://ubiquity/content/test.html

Alternatively, the suite can be run from the command-line with:

  python manage.py test
